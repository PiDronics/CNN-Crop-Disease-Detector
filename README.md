## Convolutional Neural Network.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or Conv Nets) is well known for its widely used in applications of image and video recognition and also in recommender systems and Natural Language Processing(NLP). However, convolutional is more efficient because it reduces the number of parameters which makes different from other deep learning models.
